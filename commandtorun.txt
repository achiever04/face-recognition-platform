2. Better Alerts UI

Goal: Make alerts more useful and less noisy.

Steps:

Color-code alerts:

🔴 if distance < 0.4 (high confidence).

🟡 if 0.4 ≤ distance < 0.6 (medium).

⚪ otherwise.

Group alerts by target person → show the latest location per person instead of listing duplicates.

Add a collapsible “History” section if the officer wants full details.

3. Admin/Officer Panel (Optional)

Goal: Give officers control over detections.

Steps:

New React page → /admin.

Table view of all logs from MongoDB.

Buttons: ✅ Confirm / ❌ Reject detection.

Search bar by target name → filter logs.

Store confirmation status in MongoDB.

4. Tracking per Criminal File (Your New Request)

Goal: Keep a separate file for each uploaded target to log their movement path across cameras.

Steps:

When uploading a face, take the filename (e.g., john_doe.jpg).

In backend (db.py or camera.py):

Create/open a file named logs/john_doe.txt.

Append each movement entry like:

[2025-09-19 19:30:22] Detected at Camera 2 (Main Gate, Geo=XYZ)


This way, each criminal has their own path file.

Optionally → also keep JSON format for structured history.

5. Advanced Features (Most Important)
5.1 Privacy-Preserving Recognition (Federated Learning)

Instead of storing raw images, train/update embeddings locally and share only weights.

Steps:

Store embeddings only, never raw photos.

Add optional encryption before storing face vectors.

Prepare design for federated learning (PyTorch Federated or Flower library).

5.2 DeepFake Detection in Streams

Detect if the detected face is synthetic/fake.

Steps:

Integrate a pretrained DeepFake detection model (e.g., XceptionNet or Vision Transformer based).

Run inference on frames before recognition.

If fake → log separately (deepfake_logs).

5.3 Blacklist/Watchlist Geo-Fencing

Define restricted zones for criminals.

Steps:

Extend DB schema with watchlist (target + allowed zones).

If detected outside allowed zone → raise an urgent alert.

UI should highlight with 🚨.

5.4 Occlusion Handling (Masks, Helmets)

Detect face occlusions before recognition.

Steps:

Use pretrained occlusion detection model (YOLO or CNN-based).

If face is occluded → run masked-face recognition model (ArcFace trained with masks).

Store “occluded detection” separately in DB for officer review.

🚀 Execution Order (Roadmap)

Admin Panel (optional)

Advanced Features (priority)

Privacy-preserving recognition

DeepFake detection

Blacklist/geo-fencing

Occlusion handling


















2. main.py (backend/app/main.py)

Update /face/upload endpoint:

Remove raw image saving (or make optional).

Store only embedding (encrypted if implemented).

Add new endpoint(s) for sending/receiving federated weights:

e.g., /face/fl/upload_weights, /face/fl/get_weights.

3. camera.py (backend/app/routes/camera.py)

Modify the recognition pipeline to work with embeddings only.

Optional: Integrate local model update logic for federated learning before comparing with server embeddings.

4. state.py (backend/app/state.py)

Store embeddings in memory or temporary encrypted form.

Add structures for federated learning weights (e.g., per client).

5. Frontend (App.jsx or separate FL dashboard)

Optional: Interface to trigger FL model updates from client devices.

Display current FL status per camera/client.

























Perfect ✅ You’re asking the right thing — the order matters so imports don’t break.
Here’s the safe order of implementation so you won’t get errors while adding RetinaFace + MobileNetV3 DeepFake detection:

📌 Implementation Order

backend/app/state.py (Update first)

Define placeholders for models (DEEPFAKE_MODEL, RETINAFACE_DETECTOR).

This ensures other files can import them safely without crashing.

backend/app/utils/deepfake_utils.py (New)

Write helpers to load RetinaFace + MobileNetV3 and run detection/classification.

This will use the globals defined in state.py.

backend/app/utils/db.py (Update)

Add function to log DeepFake detection results into deepfake_logs.

Keeps consistency with how you store embeddings.

backend/app/routes/deepfake.py (New)

Expose /face/deepfake_detect endpoint.

Calls functions from deepfake_utils.py and stores logs with db.py.

backend/app/main.py (Update)

Register the new DeepFake router so FastAPI knows about it.

frontend/src/api.js (Update last)

Add detectDeepFake() API call for frontend integration.
